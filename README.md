# Sudoku_Solver_Generator
 Sudoku analysis and generation C# program. 
 The only algorithm used is non-backtracking.
 The algorithm used is 
   Single, LockedCandidate, (hidden)LockedSet(2D-7D),
   (Finned)(Franken/Mutant/Kraken)Fish(2D-7D),
   Skyscraper, EmptyRectangle, XY-Wing, W-Wing, RemotePair, XChain, XYChain,
   SueDeCoq, (Multi)Coloring,
   ALS-Wing, ALS-XZ, ALS-Chain,
   (ALS)DeathBlossom(Ext.), (Grouped)NiceLoop, ForceChain and
   GeneralLogic.
There are also functions for transposed transformation of Sudoku problems, standardization and ordering of Sudoku problems.
