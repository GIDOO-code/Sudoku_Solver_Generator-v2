		<h2>Kraken (Finned)Fish</h2>
		<p>
		Kraken (Finned) Fish is an algorithm that combines Super Link with Fish.
		In the explanation here, i use simple Fish, but also with Franken/Mutant Fish.
		Furthermore, it also holds with generalized BaseSet/CoverSet.</p>
		<p>
		In Fish(left figure), if circled X is true, one of CoverSet's House is false, so Fish breaks.
		Also, in Finned Fish(right figure), if circled X is true, Fish breaks because one House is false.<br>
		</p>
		<img src="images/img38/img38a.jpg" width="496" height="251">	
		<p>In another expression, there is a weak link relationship 
		between the circled X and the CoverSet X that constitutes the Fish.<br></p>
		<img src="images/img38/img38b.png" width="496" height="251">
		<p>Kraken (Finned) Fish is an analysis algorithm that extends the effect of 1 link to link concatenation.
		Links can be linked with super links (cell-to-cell link, cell group link, ALS link).<br><br>
		</p>

		<p>
		Here is an example of Kraken (Finned) Fish.
		Kraken Fish is established for each of the inverted cells of the cell.
		However, there may be contradiction if the configuration cell of CoverSet or Fin cell becomes false.
		This depends on the false cell/number as the starting point.
